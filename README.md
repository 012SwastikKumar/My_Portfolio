## About Me

Hey there! I'm Swastik Kumar, a CSE student with a passion for problem-solving, web development, and creating delightful user experiences. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

### Background

I've always been fascinated by the world of Computer Science and have spent years refining my skills and knowledge in this field. I am currently pursuing a degree i.e. Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Chandigarh University, where I dove deep into programming and learned the best practices for building high-quality software.

### Expertise

My expertise lies in the exciting realm of the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. With this powerful combination, I can develop robust and interactive web applications from front to back. I love tackling complex problems and finding elegant solutions, all while keeping the end user in mind.

When it comes to crafting engaging user experiences, I bring my UI/UX skills into play. Using Figma, a fantastic design tool, I create intuitive interfaces that not only look great but also prioritize usability. By translating user requirements into well-designed web applications, I aim to make the digital world a more user-friendly place.

### Projects

On my GitHub profile, you'll find a diverse collection of projects that highlight my abilities and creativity. From building dynamic web applications to designing seamless user interfaces, I enjoy taking on challenges that push my skills to the next level. Feel free to explore these projects and get a taste of my work firsthand!
